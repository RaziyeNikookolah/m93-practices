Git workflow refers to a set of guidelines and practices that developers follow when using Git, a distributed version control system.
 It defines the steps and processes involved in managing and collaborating on a project using Git. 
While there are various Git workflows, I'll explain the commonly used "feature branch workflow" as an example.

The feature branch workflow typically involves the following steps:

1)Create a branch: For each new feature or task, a developer creates a new branch in the Git repository. 
This branch acts as a separate workspace to work on that particular feature.

2)Checkout the branch: The developer switches to the newly created branch, making it the active workspace. 
They can now start making changes and adding code related to the feature they are working on.

3)Commit changes: As the developer makes changes to the codebase, they periodically commit those changes to the branch. 
Each commit represents a snapshot of the code at a specific point in time, allowing for easy tracking and collaboration.

4)Push the branch: Once the developer has made significant progress or completed their feature, they push the branch to the remote repository. 
This step makes the branch accessible to other team members for review or integration.

5)Pull request (PR): After pushing the branch, the developer creates a pull request, which is 
a request to merge their branch into the main codebase (often the "master" or "main" branch). 
The pull request includes details about the changes made, allowing others to review the code and provide feedback.

6)Code review: Other team members review the code changes in the pull request, 
providing feedback, suggesting improvements, and ensuring the changes align with the project's standards.

7)Merge the branch: If the code review is successful, the branch is merged into 
the main branch, incorporating the new feature or changes into the codebase. At this point, the feature branch has served its purpose and can be deleted.

8)Pull and update: After the merge, team members who are working on the project pull 
the latest changes from the main branch to update their local repositories. This ensures that everyone has the most up-to-date codebase.

This workflow promotes collaboration, allows for independent work on different features, 
and maintains a clear history of changes. However, it's important to note that Git workflows can 
vary based on the specific needs and preferences of a development team. Different workflows like Gitflow, GitHub flow, 
or GitLab flow may have additional or slightly different steps to suit different project requirements.
